# Synthetic Data Generator

This project generates synthetic data for use in various applications, such as testing, analysis, or prototyping. The data is exported as both an Excel file (`synthetic_data.xlsx`) and a CSV file (`synthetic_data.csv`).

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Install Node.js
- Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Verify installation by running the following commands:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v

### 2. Clone or Download the Repository
- Clone the repository or download the script files.

### 3. Install Dependencies
- Navigate to the project folder and install the required Node.js libraries:
  ```bash
  npm ci
  ```

### 4. Run the Script
- Run the script using the following command:
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```

### 5. Output Files
- After running the script, two files will be created in the project directory:
  - `synthetic_data.xlsx`: An Excel file containing the synthetic data.
  - `synthetic_data.csv`: A CSV file containing the synthetic data.

## Code Explanation

The script performs the following steps:
1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
   - Uses the `@faker-js/faker` library to create 3,000 records of data with fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, `purchaseDate`, etc.
   
2. **Export to Excel**:
   - Uses the `xlsx` library to export the data to an Excel file (`synthetic_data.xlsx`).
   
3. **Export to CSV**:
   - Converts the synthetic data to CSV format and saves it as `synthetic_data.csv`.

## Example Data Fields

Here are the fields included in the generated data:
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `name`: Full name
- `email`: Email address
- `purchaseDate`: Recent date of purchase
- `productName`: Random product name
- `quantity`: Quantity purchased (1-10)
- `price`: Price of the product
- `totalValue`: Total transaction value
- `location`: Random city name
- `paymentMethod`: Payment method (e.g., credit card, wire transfer)
- `satisfactionRating`: Customer satisfaction rating (1-5)

## Dependencies

The following libraries are used in the project:
- `@faker-js/faker`: Generates realistic fake data.
- `xlsx`: Creates and writes Excel files.
- `fs`: Built-in Node.js module for file system operations (used to create the CSV file).

## Customization

- You can modify the number of records generated by changing the `generateData` function's argument:
  ```javascript
  const data = generateData(5000); // Generates 5000 records
  ```

- To add or modify fields, edit the `generateData` function and update the object structure:
  ```javascript
  {
      id: faker.string.uuid(),
      name: faker.person.fullName(),
      // Add new fields here
  }
  ```
